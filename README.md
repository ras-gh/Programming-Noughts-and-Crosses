# Programming-Noughts-and-Crosses
A project to create a standard Noughts and Crosses game from scratch

I decided to explore programming a noughts and crosses game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
First, I wanted to understand how many different possibilities there are for a winning line.
It turns out there are 3 horizontal rows (lines) and 3 vertical lines, plus 2 diagonal lines.
So that means there are 8 possibilities for a win.
Each of these I chose to check for with an individual 'if' statement.
I created a container with 9 equal squares using CSS to style the container.
Next, I created some placeholders for text to display scores, plus a button to be able to start a new game.
My aim is to make the computer play automatically, but at this stage I have the game working for 2 players whereby both players can take a turn by making a selection using the mouse.
When a win is identified, the score is updated and the user can click the 'New Game' button to start again.

UPDATE 20/3/24
I have now added the finished version which allows one player to play against the computer.
The files for this version are indexv2.html and scriptv2.js
